# Staking SNOB for xSNOB

This guide covers how to stake your SNOB tokens. Staking will lock your SNOB for a predetermined amount of time and in return you will receive xSNOB. Before depositing, learn about all the benefits of holding xSNOB [**here**](https://snowballs.gitbook.io/snowball-docs/governance/xsnob).

1\) Head to the staking page of our website [**here**](https://app.snowball.network/staking). Make sure you connect your wallet and that you are currently on the Avalanche Chain.

2\) Enter the amount of SNOB you would like to stake and the amount of time you would like to stake it for. _Staked SNOB will be locked for the duration of your stake and cannot be traded or unlocked._

3\) Once you are certain about your deposit, click on **APPROVE AND CREATE LOCK**, then sign the transaction in your wallet once prompted.

**Congratulations!** Your SNOB is now locked and you have now received xSNOB in exchange. If you don't see your xSNOB balance reflected yet on-site, just refresh the page.
