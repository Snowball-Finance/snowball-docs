# Voting on Gauges with xSNOB

This guide covers voting on gauges with xSNOB to determine the allocation of SNOB rewards. Once you have voted, your vote will remain in place, unless you change your vote. To learn more about the functionality of gauges, check out our documentation [**here**](../../governance/xsnob/gauges.md).

1\) Head to the staking page of our website [**here**](https://app.snowball.network/staking).

2\) Click on **Vote**.

3\) Select the pools you would like to vote for through the drop down menu. Alternatively, click **SELECT ALL** to view all the pools simultaneously (this does not force you to vote on every pool).
