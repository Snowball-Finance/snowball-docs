# Audits & Timelocks

## **Smart Contract Audits** <a href="#smart-contract-audits" id="smart-contract-audits"></a>

Snowball originated as a fork of Pickle Finance and Saddle Finance, both of which have been thoroughly audited. Their audits can be found [**here**](https://github.com/pickle-finance/protocol/tree/master/audits) and [**here**](https://github.com/saddle-finance/saddle-audits), respectively.

Protocol-wide Snowball audits are under way and will be published soon.

## Timelocks

All Snowball contracts have a 24 hour timelock for any upgrades, updates or changes. Furthermore, all key admin functions on contracts, including any SNOB token emissions, are also subjected to a 24 hour timelock.
