# Introduction

![](.gitbook/assets/Banner.jfif)

Snowball is a [_**Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**_](resources/defi-glossary.md#decentralized-finance-defi) protocol built on the Avalanche blockchain. It was launched in early March, 2021 and was the first auto-compounder and stable-asset exchange on the network.
