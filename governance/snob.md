## **How to earn SNOB**

SNOB is earned by using Snowball’s products. When you deposit into a product on Snowball, you receive a receipt token that can be deposited again to earn SNOB.

The amount of SNOB you get for depositing in each product varies weekly and is determined by Snowball’s gauges. View this week’s SNOB distribution on the [**xSNOB**](https://app.snowball.network/staking) page of our website, or a history of distributions [**here**](xsnob/revenue-sharing.md#historical-distributions).

SNOB can also be purchased on exchanges. [**Pangolin**](https://info.pangolin.exchange/#/token/0xc38f41a296a4493ff429f1238e030924a1542e50) and [**Trader Joe**](https://analytics.traderjoexyz.com/tokens/0xc38f41a296a4493ff429f1238e030924a1542e50) both support the SNOB token.
