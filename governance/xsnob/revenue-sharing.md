# Revenue Sharing

xSNOB revenue sharing allows users to claim 30% of Snowball's weekly revenue. This revenue is distributed weekly in the form of market-bought SNOB.

Anyone who stakes SNOB for xSNOB is eligible to claim revenue sharing rewards. Rewards are distributed based on your proportion of the total xSNOB supply:

$$
\text{SNOB Reward} = \frac{\text{0.3 ∗ Weekly Revenue ∗ User xSNOB Balance}} {\text{xSNOB Total Supply}}
$$

As of November 2021, xSNOB holders also receive AXIAL token rewards. Details of such distributions can be seen through AXIAL's tokenomics [**here**](https://docs.axial.exchange/tokenomics/axial).
{% endhint %}

## Revenue Sharing Calendar

**The payday for rewards happens every Thursday morning at 0 UTC.**

You will start receiving rewards the week after you make your first deposit. This means that if you stake your SNOB after Thursday at 0 UTC, you will not receive rewards for that week. You will start receiving rewards for every week after that.

These rewards can be claimed every week until your xSNOB balance reaches 0 (at the end of your predetermined lock period). **If you don't claim your rewards each week, you will not lose them.** You can claim them at any time, even after your lock period is over. There is no penalty for late claims and/or forgetfulness. Your SNOB might get lonely though.
