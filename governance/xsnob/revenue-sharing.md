# Revenue Sharing

xSNOB revenue sharing allows users to claim 30% of Snowball's weekly revenue. This revenue is distributed weekly in the form of market-bought SNOB.

Anyone who stakes SNOB for xSNOB is eligible to claim revenue sharing rewards. Rewards are distributed based on your proportion of the total xSNOB supply:

$$
\text{SNOB Reward} = \frac{\text{0.3 ∗ Weekly Revenue ∗ User xSNOB Balance}} {\text{xSNOB Total Supply}}
$$

### Revenue Sharing Calendar

You will start receiving rewards the week after you make your first deposit. The payday for rewards happens every Wednesday.

These rewards can be claimed every week until your xSNOB balance reaches 0 (at the end of your predetermined lock period). Alternatively, you can claim all your rewards once you get to that point. There is no penalty for doing so.
